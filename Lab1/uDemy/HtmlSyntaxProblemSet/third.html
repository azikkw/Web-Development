<h1>About Shymbulak</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    Shymbulak (Kazakh: Şymbūlaq, Cyrillic: Шымбұлақ), also known as Chimbulak (Russian: Чимбулак, Kyrgyz: Чымбулак) is a ski resort near Almaty. It is the largest ski resort in Central Asia. It is located in the upper part of the Medeu Valley in the Zailiisky Alatau mountain range, at an elevation of 2,200 metres (7,200 ft) above sea level. The resort area is about 25 kilometres (16 mi) south of Almaty city by Medeo road. It is popular for its mild climate, large quantity of sunny days and great amount of snow through the winter (from November till May).[1]

    Shymbulak (also known as "Chimbulak") was discovered by amateur skiers in the 1940s. Soon after, it became the first downhill route in the Soviet Union. Skiers originally needed to climb up the mountain tops on foot (which took roughly 3 hours). In 1954 a 1500 meters ski tow was built.[2]

    Starting from 1961, Shymbulak hosted several USSR Championships and the Silver Edelweisse prize skiing competitions.
    <br><br>
    In 1983 it became the Olympic ski training center for the USSR. During this time, various commodities were built including restaurants and hotels.[3]
    <br><br>
    In 1985, after a thorough study of the conditions for competitions at Shymbulak, the International Ski Federation (FIS) approved three local tracks: Shymbulak-Talgar for downhill, Shymbulak for slalom and giant slalom.[4]

    In 1995 the school of alpine skiing and snowboarding "Shymbulak" was opened. The school is a member of the International Ski Instructors Association ISIA.[5]
    <br><br>
    The annual "Artyemenko" Prize competition has been held in Shymbulak since 2011. The competition is held in February. Almaty hosted the 2011 Asian Winter Games, bid for 2014 Winter Olympics, considered a bid for 2018 Winter Olympics, but decided to bid for 2022 Winter Olympics instead; Shymbulak was a venue for the alpine skiing events (both speed and technical), and would have been for the latter.[6]
